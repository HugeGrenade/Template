0.2 (xxxx-xx-xx)
----
- Added tests for the Autoloader class


0.1 (2011-12-24)
----
- Changed the internal architecture to work with a tokenizer.
- When a cached template is written, this is now done using a temp file to prevent errors if some
  other template instance is trying to read from this file at the same time.
- All nodes now inherit from the Parser\Node class. If you want to write your own tags, you need
  to do the same.
- Implemented auto escaping for variables. This behaviour can be disabled in the Environment class
  or overruled with the 'safe' modifier. e.g. {$name|safe}
