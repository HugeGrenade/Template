----
- Changed the internal architecture to work with a tokenizer.
- When a cached template is written, this is now done using a temp file to prevent errors if some
  other template instance is trying to read from this file at the same time.
- All nodes now inherit from the Parser\Node class. If you want to write your own tags, you need
  to do the same.
